                        <p>From an event perspective, the main target audience were Computer enthusiasts across different colleges. 
                        Thus the main challenge was to generate maximum awareness and participation.</p>
                            <br>
                        <p>
                            Being a student-funded event, a limited section of the budget was provided for Branding/Design and promotions. 
                            Hence a proper utilization of print-media and digital-medium was necessary. Along with that Equinox also needed to 
                            stand out from the pack as a top-tier student-driven event.

                       <p>Each branding process start's with an understanding of the product/event's uniqueness and value. Because the event wanted 
                       a high-end professional look, we kept the branding very clean, minimal and modern. To achieve this a neutral color palette was 
                       established for the core branding. </p>
                           <br>
                        <p>The result was an eye-catching identity that helped the event portray its uniqueness and energy. We also extended the visual 
                        system to other aspects of the event, to make it more our approach more efficient.

                       <p>When I started this project a lot of attention was given towards gathering inputs and research from the target audience. My own
                           experience being a student and participating in such events helped in recognizing the areas of improvement and the components that needed to be changed</p>
                           <br>
                        <p>I primarily worked on the logo and color palette in the beginning and then gradually worked on promotional posters and brochure.
                            With the increasing response and the hype generated, I also worked towards designing merchandise which still has a record sale across all editions of the event.

                            A central input was towards shifting from wordmark logo towards an abstract or a combination based logo.
                            The new design was expected to be more playful and fresh still simple with abstract elements.

                        <p>To make the event engaging for the students we designed official merchandise for the event and had arranged for presale of it during event 
                        registration and other promotional activities. The merchandise included t-shirt, wristbands, event bands and badges.

                        <p>
                            The Merchandise was an instant hit and over 300+ Merchandise Set (t-shirt+band) were sold. 
                            Students in the department still wear the t-shirt with pride.

                        <p> The event was a tremendous success and received a record turnout of participants for it. 
                        The design was appreciated along with promotional strategies such as the introduction of merchandise.

                        <p> Being my first professional project, being true to the event's tagline this was the best platform 
                        for me to develop and test my design skills. There are many things I would have done differently especially 
                        in terms of color palette and the consistency in the overall branding project. Having said that this project 
                        will always be of personal significance for me.
