                            tools and modules to assist its user to execute effective financial strategies.
                            <br><br>
                            However, the financial data that CRISIL owns covers vast segments of data that comes in different formats. With such large

                            these resources and make something simple, informative and easy to use helping the user's find what they need ?</p>

                       <p> Although our brief was to develop a web application that enables users to perform complex calculations on 
                           financial data and provide accurate results with the help of different tools, we stressed that merely focusing on the function
                           could neither compete with the other competitor apps in the market, nor had the best interests of the app's use at heart.
                           <br><br>
                           To differentiate ourselves in such a competitive market, we needed to find a desirable role for the application and how it would
                           meet the both functional and aesthetic needs of the users. We wanted to design something more meaningful.
