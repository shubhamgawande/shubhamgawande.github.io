                       <p> Although our brief was to develop a web application that enables users to perform complex calculations on 
                           financial data and provide accurate results with the help of different tools, we stressed that merely focusing on the function
                           could neither compete with the other competitor apps in the market, nor had the best interests of the app's use at heart.

                           To differentiate ourselves in such a competitive market, we needed to find a desirable role for the application and how it would
                           meet both the functional and aesthetic needs of the users. We wanted to design something more meaningful.

                        <p> Industry Profile is one of the core modules of the application. The module provides the user with access to data of 
                        about 200+ industries across India with the ability to perform analytical operations to gain insights. Being one of the 
                        core modules of application it was also one of the most difficult ones to design considering the amount of data that was 
                        to be made available to the user. The data was represented in tabular and graphical form along with filters and other input 
                        operations whenever necessary.

                        <p> The Quantix Application was a very large and complex working application and took several months to design 
                        and create with multiple releases. To arrive at the final design, we completed a thorough analysis of all the 
                        sections and also with the business team to make sure all their requirements were met in terms of overall performance. 
                        Additionally, I have received positive feedback from the users about the simplified and direct approach towards 
                        the design and the complete user experience.
