                          <p>TEDxSIMSREE is an independently organised TED-like event by Sydenham Institute of Management Studies, Research and Entrepreneurship Education. 
                            The objective of the event is to make TEDxSIMSREE a platform where community-driven people can showcase their ideas that will lead to a change 
                            in attitudes, lives and, ultimately, the world. </p> <br>
                          <p> 
                           As a student of the organizing Institute, I believed I could contribute in better explaining the concepts of the event and giving the audience
                           a brief introduction of the potential speakers for the same. I also emphasized on how to use this website
                           as a medium to connect more and more people to TEDxSIMSREE.

                         <p>The target audience mainly consisted of students, hence the website had to be compatible on mobile devices. Being maiden TED event at
                         SIMSREE, the idea and purpose behind organizing the event was to be explained to potential audience.

                            <br>
                        <p>We also had to plan a simple ticketing platform for audience to reserve their seats for the event. 
                        The website would also provide advertising space for the sponsors and provide links to their respective websites without hampering the user experience.</p>

                       <p> A responsive design approach was selcted for the website to be compatible on multiple devices.
                       The modern and minimal approach to the design would help the event perfectly capture the theme of the event.
                       For ticketing purpose simple google form verification was used along with UPI transactions on registered mobile numbers.</p>

                        <p> I researched extensively about the organization on it's <a class="paraLink" href="https://www.ted.com/" target="_blank">Official Website</a>. This helped
                        me understand their design guidelines as well as other important aspects of the event.
                        We initially started with a single page website with scrolling navigation menu.</p> <br>
                        <p> As we developed and tested the first prototype on devices with smaller screen size, we realized the scrolling area
                        for the user was hindering the experience because of the length of the data to be presented. </p> <br> <p> We also realized a full screen menu with multiple pages worked best on mobile screen. We incorporated our 
                        insights along with initial feedback from Organizing committee to then shift to a multiple page approach.</p>
